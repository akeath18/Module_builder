          "heading": "How Oxygen Delivery Limits Performance",
          "body": "Aerobic performance depends on how effectively your body delivers and uses oxygen. Cardiac output (heart rate x stroke volume) determines oxygen delivery from the heart, while local muscle factors such as capillary density and mitochondrial enzymes determine oxygen use. VO2max represents the highest rate at which your system can take in and use oxygen during intense exercise."
        },
        {
          "heading": "What Recovery Heart Rate Tells You",
          "body": "Recovery heart rate is a marker of how quickly the autonomic nervous system shifts from stress response back toward resting balance. Faster recovery generally reflects stronger cardiorespiratory efficiency and better readiness for repeated work. Slower recovery suggests that training intensity or density may need to be reduced temporarily."

If capacity markers are low and recovery is slow, begin with conservative intensity and smaller weekly progression steps. If capacity is higher and recovery is stable, progression can increase gradually while monitoring tolerance."

        {
          "heading": "Why Strength Intensity Matters",
          "body": "Strength adaptation is strongly influenced by relative load because load affects motor unit recruitment. As intensity increases, higher-threshold motor units are recruited and mechanical tension rises. This is why training percentage zones are used as a conceptual proxy for expected neuromuscular demand."

          "heading": "Why We Use Submaximal Prediction",
          "body": "Direct 1RM testing can be useful but may be inappropriate in some contexts due to skill level, fatigue state, or safety constraints. Submaximal tests combined with prediction equations estimate maximal strength while reducing risk. These models are not perfect; they are estimates that require interpretation rather than blind acceptance."
        },
        {
          "heading": "How to Interpret Intensity Zones",
          "body": "Different intensity bands shift adaptation emphasis. Moderate-to-high relative intensity often supports foundational strength development in novices because it provides sufficient mechanical stimulus while still allowing technical consistency. The concept is dose-response: enough load for adaptation, not so much that quality collapses."

          "heading": "Structural Balance and Force Distribution",

          "heading": "Why Push-Pull Symmetry Matters",

          "body": "In novices, moderate progression in both volume and intensity often works better than extreme emphasis on one variable.
